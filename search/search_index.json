A welcome reprieve after the region's long precipitation season.  The phrase itself conjures recollection of the sun reflecting off lakes, lush mountains, long sun-drenched days and the aromatic flora surrounding us.  It's a time when nature bursts forth in growth and calls us to act on ambitious outdoor projects.  We are called to begin the constant effort of tending to our outdoor spaces.  Just like a flourishing garden, an enterprise network requires constant attention.</p> <p>Imagine your garden. A persistent patch of dandelions has taken root, their bright yellow heads a cheerful but ultimately detrimental sight. You could, of course, easily snip off the heads.  For a brief time, the problem appears to be gone.  The garden looks tidier. This is the equivalent of fixing a problem on your network.  A switch port goes down; you reboot the switch.  A user complains of slow access; you restart their machine. These are quick, reactive measures that address the immediate symptoms. They offer a temporary reprieve, a superficial act masking a deeper issue.  The dandelions, you see, still have their roots firmly embedded, ready to sprout anew with the next rainfall.  What's worse, we frequently water our gardens in between rainfall encouraging weed growth at that same pace as our desirable growth.</p> <p>Weeding, on the other hand, is a more deliberate and far more effective process.  It involves getting down on your hands and knees, understanding the plant's growth pattern, and carefully extracting the entire root system.  It's often messier, much more time-consuming, and requires a deeper understanding of the underlying biology.  Much like solving that persistent fundamental problem with your network.</p> <p>Consider that slow application complaint, this time it\u2019s from a corporate VIP.  Instead of a quick reboot, a \"weeding\" approach would involve delving into the network.  Is it a bandwidth issue?  A misconfigured QoS setting?  A rogue application monopolizing resources?  Are there aging, non-standard cables or faulty network cards that are consistently degrading performance?  Perhaps the network architecture itself, once perfectly adequate, is no longer scaling to meet the modern demands of today\u2019s workforce or new cloud-based applications.   </p> <p>Identifying the root cause requires a comprehensive view of the network path and its performance \u2013  whether it's an inefficient proprietary feature / protocol, a tangle of software versions laced with their unique bugs, or a lack of proper network segmentation; you wouldn't know which root to pull without visibility across the entire packet path.  Demand for immediate relief may not afford you the time for systematically addressing it hence the giving in to clipping the weed.</p> <p>Maintaining an enterprise LAN is not merely about reacting to outages or defending against the criticism.  It's about proactive care and willingness to acknowledge \u201cproblems that can be solved\u201d.  Just as a gardener doesn't wait for their blooms to be overtaken by non-native plants before tending to them.  This involves continuous monitoring, performance baseline, regular security audits, and a commitment to understanding the evolving needs of the business. </p> <p>Arista Networks' CloudVision Universal Network Observability (CV UNO) is a network observability solution that leverages DANZ Monitoring Fabric (DMF) for deeper insights into network and application performance. CV UNO uses machine learning and data analytics to provide proactive risk analysis, real-time impact analysis, and accelerated issue resolution. The DMF acts as a foundation for CV UNO, providing the infrastructure for capturing and filtering network traffic, while CV UNO analyzes this data to identify anomalies and performance issue</p> <p>In the warmth of an Upstate New York summer, as the garden thrives under thoughtful cultivation, so too can your network flourish when its stewards adopt a \"weeding\" mindset. By consistently seeking out and eradicating the root causes of network architecture, devices and vulnerabilities, rather than just snipping at the symptoms, organizations can cultivate a culture of analysis and continuous improvement, where every \"fix\" is viewed as an opportunity to understand the underlying \"weed\" and actively prevent its recurrence.  The reward may well include network engineers who will enjoy more of the revitalizing seasonal activities this short season has to offer, and a business that delivers to its clients.</p>"},{"location":"#feel-free-to-reach-out-to-us-for-your-network-needs","title":"Feel Free to Reach Out To Us For Your Network Needs","text":"<p>We thank you for taking the time to read our newsletter today.

Maybe your inbox is quiet. The helpdesk isn\u2019t chasing you down. Syslog looks clean. Nobody's asking for a maintenance window. Devices have been up for months\u2014maybe even years. All signs point to a stable, well-behaved network. However, stability alone doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.</p> <p>What about security? Can that be used as a metric for good network health? I\u2019d argue yes, absolutely. Just because nothing appears broken doesn\u2019t mean your network isn\u2019t vulnerable to being exposed. A \u201chealthy\u201d network on the surface could still be running outdated software and missing critical patches.  In today\u2019s environment, a strong security posture has to be part of how we define operational health.</p> <p>So why don\u2019t we all keep our devices as current as possible? In many cases, it\u2019s not because we don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s because upgrades have historically been painful. With legacy network OS\u2019s, a software upgrade often means disruption. Even when everything goes as planned, you could still see an impact. Sometimes just 30 seconds, but even that can be too long in environments that require 24/7 availability.</p> <p>The good news is that this doesn\u2019t have to be the tradeoff anymore. If you're running a modern network OS, like Arista EOS, upgrades don\u2019t have to be a compromise. Arista Smart System Upgrade (SSU) gives you a way to upgrade software with no impact to connected hosts, even if they only have a single link. SSU keeps forwarding data during the upgrade, so users don\u2019t notice a thing (&lt; 100 ms). You can now treat software upgrades as a normal part of healthy operations without fear of outages. </p> <p>As you evaluate your network\u2019s health, make sure you\u2019re not just measuring silence. Include upgradability in your assessment. Because a healthy network isn\u2019t just quiet. It's secure.</p> <p>Want to learn more about Smart System Upgrade (SSU)?

However, as the traditional network perimeter disappears\u2014driven by the dynamic placement of applications in the cloud and the adoption of SaaS solutions\u2014organizations now face greater vulnerabilities. The push to offer seamless access to key resources for employees and contractors, often through BYOD policies, further increases this risk. Additionally, many threat actors now employ sophisticated, malware-free techniques that can cause significant damage, even when data is fully encrypted.  </p> <p>Driven by evolving security challenges, Zero Trust has emerged as a top priority for enterprises. As a leading provider of networking solutions to enterprise customers, Arista recognizes that the network itself can be leveraged to enhance enterprise security in innovative and efficient ways\u2014delivering robust protection without adding unnecessary complexity while maintaining a seamless experience for all users and stakeholders. While Zero Trust encompasses a broad range of security domains and requires contributions from various technologies\u2014including firewalls, endpoint detection and response (EDR), and other security services\u2014the network remains foundational. Every user, device, and application relies on the network to communicate, positioning it as a critical control point for enforcing security policies and enabling real-time visibility and threat response across the enterprise.  </p> <p>  Arista Zero Trust Networking </p> <p>Arista\u2019s Zero Trust architecture is a combination of various functions starting from  </p> <ol> <li> <p>Identity-based adaptive access control: Arista\u2019s AGNI (Arista Guardian Network Identity) system serves as a network access control policy engine that provides access to users and devices no matter where they connect over wired or wireless networks. It can be a policy engine for corporate users, devices, guest users, BYOD, and IoT. It meets the zero-trust requirement of trusting nothing and always knowing the identity of every endpoint. AGNI also helps operators restrict what users or devices can access once they are on the network.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Based on the user\u2019s identity, we can create identity-aware microperimeters that are completely decoupled from the underlying network topology. Arista\u2019s ZTX traffic mapper appliance (physical or virtual) can then monitor all session-level activity in the network and provide the operator a clear view of the communication activity. The operator can create policies based on that identity-aware view.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Multi Domain Microsegmentation Services (Arista MSS) can then enforce the identity-aware segmentation at the network's edge and greatly simplify or limit the need for the firewall to just inter-zone traffic\u2014this kind of identity-aware enforcement further limits lateral movement within the network. Even if someone were to infiltrate the network, Arista MSS would greatly reduce the attacker's ability by restricting movement beyond what is allowed for that group, which is explicitly governed through the policy. Any traffic that does not match the policy is redirected to the firewalls for further inspection.  </p> </li> <li> <p>The native built-in NDR (Network Detection and Response) capability within Arista switches discovers, profiles, and tracks devices, users, and applications using AI-based fingerprinting and detects sophisticated threats with the lowest noise possible. This meets the continuous monitoring requirement of a network built with Zero Trust principles.  </p> </li> </ol> <p>To learn more about Arista\u2019s Zero Trust approach, please visit the following link below: Arista Zero Trust Networking </p>"},{"location":"May2025/#the-evolution-of-arista-eos-from-sysdb-to-netdl","title":"The Evolution of Arista EOS: From SysDB to NetDL","text":"<p>By: Frough Taihary &amp; Alex Bojko, Advanced Services Engineer, South East Region  </p> <p>Arista Networks\u2019 Extensible Operating System (EOS) has been a game-changer in networking, offering a modular, programmable, and highly resilient architecture. Unlike traditional network operating systems, EOS is built on a database-driven model, enabling real-time state streaming and management.    </p> <p>This article explores the evolution of EOS, focusing on its core databases\u2014SysDB, NetDB, and NetDL.  </p> <p>SysDB is the core of a switch that holds the state information of a switch. SysDB, or System Database,  exists in every Arista switch. It stores the state of all 100+ agents, or processes, running on the switch. The agents communicate through a publish and subscribe model to SysDB, therefore agents do not communicate with each other directly but only with SysDB. This prevents agent interdependency and cascading failures within the operating system. Also, by separating agent state from processing, we have created a more resilient and fault tolerant switching architecture. An agent that goes offline simply needs to pull its last known state from SysDB upon re-initilization to begin processing as if no failure occurred. To summarize, SysDB serves as a centralized database within each EOS switch, however, the next evolution of EOS goes beyond a single device.   </p> <p> </p> <p>NetDB is the next evolution of EOS, and it operates by collecting data from all of our Arista EOS switches. NetDB allows us to aggregate all the switches' state information in one location. The evolution from SysDB to NetDB led to the creation of our Network management and orchestration platform CloudVision. While this was a big step forward, we wanted to expand our visibility from EOS devices to now include information from all aspects of our network.   </p> <p>NetDL is the latest evolution of EOS. NetDL is a series of databases that aggregates information from all aspects of our network, not just the switching infrastructure. This can include data from our EOS devices, wireless, security, IoT, Virtualized, and 3rd party infrastructure. This led to the creation of CV-UNO (Universal Network Observability), which ingests all of the additional data into CloudVision, giving the network operator much wider visibility into their entire network.
