Maybe your inbox is quiet. The helpdesk isn\u2019t chasing you down. Syslog looks clean. Nobody's asking for a maintenance window. Devices have been up for months\u2014maybe even years. All signs point to a stable, well-behaved network. However, stability alone doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.</p> <p>What about security? Can that be used as a metric for good network health? I\u2019d argue yes, absolutely. Just because nothing appears broken doesn\u2019t mean your network isn\u2019t vulnerable to being exposed. A \u201chealthy\u201d network on the surface could still be running outdated software and missing critical patches.  In today\u2019s environment, a strong security posture has to be part of how we define operational health.</p> <p>So why don\u2019t we all keep our devices as current as possible? In many cases, it\u2019s not because we don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s because upgrades have historically been painful. With legacy network OS\u2019s, a software upgrade often means disruption. Even when everything goes as planned, you could still see an impact. Sometimes just 30 seconds, but even that can be too long in environments that require 24/7 availability.</p> <p>The good news is that this doesn\u2019t have to be the tradeoff anymore. If you're running a modern network OS, like Arista EOS, upgrades don\u2019t have to be a compromise. Arista Smart System Upgrade (SSU) gives you a way to upgrade software with no impact to connected hosts, even if they only have a single link. SSU keeps forwarding data during the upgrade, so users don\u2019t notice a thing (&lt; 100 ms). You can now treat software upgrades as a normal part of healthy operations without fear of outages. </p> <p>As you evaluate your network\u2019s health, make sure you\u2019re not just measuring silence. Include upgradability in your assessment. Because a healthy network isn\u2019t just quiet. It's secure.</p> <p>Want to learn more about Smart System Upgrade (SSU)?

The term \u201cswitch\u201d is tossed around like it\u2019s just one box to plug in and call it a day. After all, isn\u2019t a switch just a switch? But what if I told you that a switch can be much more than a simple piece of hardware? In fact, the right switch can be the difference between a network that\u2019s stuck in the past and one that\u2019s ready for the future. The truth is, not all switches are created equal. Arista Networks provides the critical infrastructure for your network so that it doesn\u2019t just survive\u2014it thrives.</p> <p>For years, network managers in Upstate New York have been trapped with legacy networking equipment that\u2019s as complicated as it is expensive. The \"one-size-fits-all\" approach has led to endless subscription fees, complex configurations, and network downtime that simply shouldn\u2019t exist in 2025. What Arista offers is not just another switch. For over 20 years, Arista has pioneered a new way of thinking about networking. Think to yourself, \u201cHave I seen a movie on Netflix lately, posted a picture on Facebook or listened to a song on Spotify?\u201d If so, you\u2019ve already experienced the power of Arista Networks!</p> <p>With Arista\u2019s Extensible Operating System (EOS), switches are no longer just about connecting devices. They\u2019re about automating network operations with CloudVision, optimizing performance, and simplifying management.

However, as the traditional network perimeter disappears\u2014driven by the dynamic placement of applications in the cloud and the adoption of SaaS solutions\u2014organizations now face greater vulnerabilities. The push to offer seamless access to key resources for employees and contractors, often through BYOD policies, further increases this risk. Additionally, many threat actors now employ sophisticated, malware-free techniques that can cause significant damage, even when data is fully encrypted.  </p> <p>Driven by evolving security challenges, Zero Trust has emerged as a top priority for enterprises. As a leading provider of networking solutions to enterprise customers, Arista recognizes that the network itself can be leveraged to enhance enterprise security in innovative and efficient ways\u2014delivering robust protection without adding unnecessary complexity while maintaining a seamless experience for all users and stakeholders. While Zero Trust encompasses a broad range of security domains and requires contributions from various technologies\u2014including firewalls, endpoint detection and response (EDR), and other security services\u2014the network remains foundational. Every user, device, and application relies on the network to communicate, positioning it as a critical control point for enforcing security policies and enabling real-time visibility and threat response across the enterprise.  </p> <p>  Arista Zero Trust Networking </p> <p>Arista\u2019s Zero Trust architecture is a combination of various functions starting from  </p> <ol> <li> <p>Identity-based adaptive access control: Arista\u2019s AGNI (Arista Guardian Network Identity) system serves as a network access control policy engine that provides access to users and devices no matter where they connect over wired or wireless networks. It can be a policy engine for corporate users, devices, guest users, BYOD, and IoT. It meets the zero-trust requirement of trusting nothing and always knowing the identity of every endpoint. AGNI also helps operators restrict what users or devices can access once they are on the network.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Based on the user\u2019s identity, we can create identity-aware microperimeters that are completely decoupled from the underlying network topology. Arista\u2019s ZTX traffic mapper appliance (physical or virtual) can then monitor all session-level activity in the network and provide the operator a clear view of the communication activity. The operator can create policies based on that identity-aware view.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Multi Domain Microsegmentation Services (Arista MSS) can then enforce the identity-aware segmentation at the network's edge and greatly simplify or limit the need for the firewall to just inter-zone traffic\u2014this kind of identity-aware enforcement further limits lateral movement within the network. Even if someone were to infiltrate the network, Arista MSS would greatly reduce the attacker's ability by restricting movement beyond what is allowed for that group, which is explicitly governed through the policy. Any traffic that does not match the policy is redirected to the firewalls for further inspection.  </p> </li> <li> <p>The native built-in NDR (Network Detection and Response) capability within Arista switches discovers, profiles, and tracks devices, users, and applications using AI-based fingerprinting and detects sophisticated threats with the lowest noise possible. This meets the continuous monitoring requirement of a network built with Zero Trust principles.  </p> </li> </ol> <p>To learn more about Arista\u2019s Zero Trust approach, please visit the following link below: Arista Zero Trust Networking </p>"},{"location":"May2025/#the-evolution-of-arista-eos-from-sysdb-to-netdl","title":"The Evolution of Arista EOS: From SysDB to NetDL","text":"<p>By: Frough Taihary &amp; Alex Bojko, Advanced Services Engineer, South East Region  </p> <p>Arista Networks\u2019 Extensible Operating System (EOS) has been a game-changer in networking, offering a modular, programmable, and highly resilient architecture. Unlike traditional network operating systems, EOS is built on a database-driven model, enabling real-time state streaming and management.    </p> <p>This article explores the evolution of EOS, focusing on its core databases\u2014SysDB, NetDB, and NetDL.  </p> <p>SysDB is the core of a switch that holds the state information of a switch. SysDB, or System Database,  exists in every Arista switch. It stores the state of all 100+ agents, or processes, running on the switch. The agents communicate through a publish and subscribe model to SysDB, therefore agents do not communicate with each other directly but only with SysDB. This prevents agent interdependency and cascading failures within the operating system. Also, by separating agent state from processing, we have created a more resilient and fault tolerant switching architecture. An agent that goes offline simply needs to pull its last known state from SysDB upon re-initilization to begin processing as if no failure occurred. To summarize, SysDB serves as a centralized database within each EOS switch, however, the next evolution of EOS goes beyond a single device.   </p> <p> </p> <p>NetDB is the next evolution of EOS, and it operates by collecting data from all of our Arista EOS switches. NetDB allows us to aggregate all the switches' state information in one location. The evolution from SysDB to NetDB led to the creation of our Network management and orchestration platform CloudVision. While this was a big step forward, we wanted to expand our visibility from EOS devices to now include information from all aspects of our network.   </p> <p>NetDL is the latest evolution of EOS. NetDL is a series of databases that aggregates information from all aspects of our network, not just the switching infrastructure. This can include data from our EOS devices, wireless, security, IoT, Virtualized, and 3rd party infrastructure. This led to the creation of CV-UNO (Universal Network Observability), which ingests all of the additional data into CloudVision, giving the network operator much wider visibility into their entire network. Also, since NetDL provides us with an expansive collection of network data in one location, Arista's AI/ML solution AVA (Autonomous Virtual Assist) can leverage the data to provide customers with real time remediation recommendations, reducing MTTR.   </p> <p> </p> <p>In conclusion, EOS evolved from a single database located on a single switch, to a network wide database aggregating every switch's state information, to an encompassing series of databases aggregating data from every aspect and interaction within our network.  </p> <p>To learn more, click on the links below: Ken Duda \"EOS: A Tale of Opposite Architectures\" Ken Duda \"Arista NetDL Evolution\" Arista AVA (Autonomous Virtual Assist) </p>"},{"location":"May2025/#upcoming-events","title":"Upcoming Events","text":"<p>Arista hosts various events throughout the year for you!
