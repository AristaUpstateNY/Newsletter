However, testing, making configuration changes, or evolving your network often requires scheduled maintenance windows \u2014 typically after hours, over the weekend, or, for 24/7 operations, during the few opportunities available each year. This limited flexibility can slow innovation, delay automation efforts, and increase operational risk. But what if you could test, validate, and evolve your network \u2014 anytime \u2014 without impacting production?</p> <p>   Introducing Arista Cloud Test (ACT) </p> <p>Arista Cloud Test (ACT) provides a cost-effective, scalable, and flexible platform for network testing, automation development, and training. With ACT, you can replicate your entire network virtually, creating a fully configurable digital twin powered by vEOS that supports thousands of nodes. This means you no longer have to wait for a maintenance window to see whether a configuration change might disrupt your network. Instead, you can test safely and repeatedly in a simulated environment that mirrors your production setup.</p> <p> </p> <p>   Empowering Automation and Agility </p> <p>ACT integrates seamlessly with Arista Architect, Validate, Deploy (AVD) and GitLab, enabling your automation teams to develop and test scripts long before physical hardware arrives. This accelerates deployment timelines, enhances confidence in configuration changes, and reduces risk. You can also deploy a CloudVision node within your lab environment to explore new CloudVision features and leverage its powerful automation capabilities to orchestrate and manage your virtual network.</p> <p>   Backed by Arista TAC Support </p> <p>Even in a lab environment, you\u2019re never on your own. All ACT environments are fully supported by Arista\u2019s Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to ensure your virtual labs remain accessible, stable, and performing as expected.</p> <p>   Transform the Way You Innovate </p> <p>With Arista Cloud Test, you can:</p> <ul> <li>Validate network changes before deployment</li> <li>Develop and test automation workflows in a risk-free environment</li> <li>Train your operations teams on real-world scenarios</li> <li>Scale testing to thousands of virtual nodes with minimal cost</li> <li>Arista Cloud Test empowers your organization to innovate faster, reduce downtime risk, and evolve your network with confidence.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#article-2-blame-the-network","title":"Article #2 - Blame the Network!","text":"<p>By: Randy Longhenry, Account Executive, Upstate NY Region</p> <p>   Large Network Operational Challenges (and a Few Lessons Learned) </p> <p>Back in late 2017, I stepped into a new role as Network Manager for a large financial services company that moved nearly $1 trillion a year through its network.  To put that in perspective \u2014 only about a dozen organizations on the planet (banks + payment networks) handle more than that annually.</p> <p>Most of our business happened between 8 AM and 8 PM, Monday through Friday, and each minute of downtime was worth roughly $5 million in financial impact.</p> <p>Let\u2019s just say, keeping the network up wasn\u2019t just important \u2014 it was existential.</p> <p>   The Landscape I Inherited </p> <p>I took over a network spanning:</p> <ul> <li>3 primary data centers</li> <li>Half a dozen smaller data centers</li> <li>~150 remote offices and processing centers</li> <li>A handful of subsidiary networks and several cloud connections</li> </ul> <p>All supported by a lean team of 15 engineers responsible for every bit of design, deployment, and day-to-day operation \u2014 routing, switching, circuits, wireless \u2014 the works.</p> <p>Coming from the world of network vendors, I felt ready. I\u2019d worked as a Systems Engineer for two major manufacturers and knew the solutions extremely well.  I believed that the manufacturer we used was the industry standard for data center, campus, WAN, and wireless domains \u2014 I knew how they should work. I was optimistic.</p> <p>For a while.</p> <p>   The Reality Check </p> <p>A few months in, the honeymoon was over. Here\u2019s what I discovered:</p> <ul> <li>Fragmented Environment: Five product types, each running its own OS \u2014 and over 20 software versions in production. No easy way to track, govern or upgrade them - and a nightmare to integrate with. </li> <li>Disjointed management: Three separate management systems, none fully deployed or current (too much manual overhead).</li> <li>Zero automation: Almost all tasks were manual \u2014 even the routine ones that begged to be scripted.  The current hardware was simply not automation-friendly at all, and there was no standard automation environment.</li> <li>Limited visibility: Just SNMP polling and a couple end-of-life flow collectors. We had no real view into what traffic was doing.</li> <li>No reliable inventory: Diagrams were mostly outdated, documentation was scarce and \u201ctribal knowledge\u201d was the most reliable source of how things were built.</li> <li>Security: very difficult and time consuming to apply uniform policies across such fragmented silos - and fragments inside of silos.</li> </ul> <p>The results?</p> <ul> <li>Everything was configured manually through the CLI \u2014 one typo away from a $5M per minute outage.</li> <li>Managing code, bugs, and vulnerabilities was chaos.</li> <li>Troubleshooting meant diving into port counters with good instincts and following the breadcrumbs. </li> </ul> <p>The network was tough to manage, harder to troubleshoot, and \u2014 inevitably \u2014 the first suspect whenever anything broke in IT.  You know the drill: \u201cBlame the network!\u201d</p> <p>   Managing Risk (and Little Sleep) </p> <p>At that point, my real job title might as well have been Risk Manager.  We made almost all changes after hours or on weekends.  Every update carried weight \u2014 layers of approvals, manual steps, and plenty of stress.</p> <p>The network\u2019s complexity slowed everything down, which hurt the business we were supposed to empower.  </p> <p>Sound familiar?</p> <p>   Enter Arista: A Breath of Fresh (Network) Air </p> <p>Fast forward to 2020.</p> <p>While evaluating a data center refresh, I came across Arista \u2014 and it checked every box I\u2019d been wishing for:</p> <p>Why Arista Was a Game-Changer</p> <ul> <li>One OS to rule them all: A single EOS across data center, routing, and campus \u2014 no more juggling 20 software versions.</li> <li>Stability and security: EOS was rock solid. No more code roulette or bug hunts every upgrade cycle.</li> <li>CloudVision: The operations portal I always wanted, with:<ul> <li>Inventory management: Real-time hardware/software state, bug and CVE awareness, automated alerts.</li> <li>Automation tools: Configlets and \u201cstudios\u201d for consistent, template-based changes.</li> <li>Change control: Task management, approvals, and automation integration built right in.</li> <li>Observability: True streaming telemetry (not polling!) for live flow visibility and custom dashboards.</li> <li>Topology awareness: Real-time network views showing connectivity, utilization, and flows.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Open standards: Universal CLI and no proprietary lock-in \u2014 easy integration across environments.</li> <li>Outstanding support: Calls answered within a minute by an architect-level engineer, not a gatekeeper checking contracts.</li> </ul> <p>   The Results </p> <p>Since adopting Arista:</p> <ul> <li>Operations greatly simplified: Faster deployments, easier management.</li> <li>Reliability improved dramatically: Fewer issues, faster troubleshooting, and better collaboration across IT.</li> <li>Security strengthened: Vastly fewer vulnerability exposures and predictable upgrades.</li> </ul> <p>Most importantly to me: </p> <ul> <li>Team morale improved greatly:<ul> <li>Less after-hours work.</li> <li>Reduced change risk.</li> <li>Quick, expert support when things went sideways.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Overall, the network stopped being \u201cthe problem\u201d \u2014 it became a trusted, stable foundation for the business. </p> <p>\u201cBlame the Network\u201d?

One of those late-night runs when the crowds are gone and the shelves are half empty. Passing the bakery, I saw it: one lonely, forgotten cupcake sitting on a tray like it had missed the party.</p> <p>Then I noticed a rainbow of balloons swaying under the AC vents and had a sudden sinking feeling. Did I forget a birthday?</p> <p>I pulled out my phone to check. Sure enough, I had. But in my defense, it never said a word. Not even a hint.</p> <p>Somewhere between monitoring compliance and pushing configs, CloudVision quietly turned ten. And true to form, there was no drama, no fanfare, just a decade of being one of the most capable, feature-rich, and underrated platforms in networking.</p> <p>So yes, this article is a belated birthday card. No balloons. But I did buy the cupcake \ud83e\uddc1.</p> <p>In an industry where platforms are often discarded and reinvented every few years, CloudVision stands out as a rare example of evolution. A decade long commitment to self-improving innovation. More than just a management interface, it has become the foundation of operational simplicity and visibility across Arista deployments.</p> <p>When CloudVision launched in 2015, it offered a single point of visibility for the entire network fabric. It was built on open standards and designed to scale. What is more impressive is how it has grown. Over the past decade, CloudVision has added live streaming telemetry, workflow automation, network auditability and compliance, campus-focused features, multi-domain security, AI-driven analytics, and much more. Not as bolt-ons or afterthoughts, but as integrated capabilities with a clear and consistent design vision that spans your entire Arista network.</p> <p>  Arista CloudVision </p> <p>For ten years, CloudVision has helped customers move from their legacy architectures to a modern operating model. It has reduced operational costs, increased uptime, and improved security. From healthcare to education to finance, and everything in between, every enterprise can benefit from doing more with less.</p> <p>I, for one, cannot wait to see what CloudVision does next.</p> <p>If you would like to learn more, check out the YouTube link below or reach out to your local Arista team.</p>"},{"location":"August2025/#article-2-from-hyperscale-to-hometown-why-the-town-of-webster-trusts-arista","title":"Article #2 - From Hyperscale to Hometown \u2013 Why the Town of Webster Trusts Arista","text":"<p>By: Jeramiah Pauly,  Associate Account Manager, Upstate NY Region</p> <p>Arista, recently named one of Forbes\u2019 Top 15 Best Companies in America for 2025, powers the backbone of global cloud giants like Microsoft and Meta. But some of our most meaningful success stories are unfolding much closer to home. One such example is in the Town of Webster, New York, where local government leaders turned to Arista to modernize their critical network infrastructure.</p> <p>This month, we spoke with Steve Peace, Director of Information Technology, and John Camille, Network Administrator for the Town of Webster, to learn how Arista is reshaping their operations from the ground up. \u201cEye-opening. That\u2019s the short version,\u201d said Camille. \u201cThe longer version? Arista has completely changed how we think about and manage our network.\u201d</p> <p>Like many municipalities, Webster\u2019s network had developed organically over time, with a patchwork of vendors and gear. That led to complexity, inconsistent configurations, and a reliance on workarounds instead of streamlined solutions. According to Camille, the change since deploying Arista has been dramatic. \u201cNow, we can rack and configure a switch on-site and push configurations through CloudVision. What used to take days now takes hours.\u201d</p> <p>CloudVision, Arista\u2019s management and analytics platform, has also revolutionized how Webster troubleshoots and plans their network. \u201cThe level of visibility and insight into client experience and network health is unmatched. We can show exactly where things are working and where they\u2019re not. No guesswork, just facts.\u201d</p> <p>Camille highlighted the daily tools that have become essential to his team\u2019s operations: dashboards, topology mapping, CVE and bug visibility, MAC address history, health monitoring, and configlet management\u2014all within CloudVision. \u201cChange management used to mean reading twenty pages of documentation, digging through forum threads, and deciphering handwritten notes,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s one platform, one book, one design. It just works. Working with Arista makes everything easier\u2014management, planning, implementation, and yes, even budgeting.\u201d</p> <p>From a leadership standpoint, the Town of Webster had clear goals: simplify network management, improve performance, and strengthen security. For Steve Peace, cost savings and long-term sustainability were critical factors in evaluating a new vendor. \u201cWe wanted to improve manageability, increase performance, eliminate vendor creep, and enhance our security posture by being able to easily install updates and fixes,\u201d Peace explained. \u201cWe also needed a solution with the fewest CVEs in the market and at a lower cost. Arista checked every box.\u201d</p> <p>According to Peace, the decision to go with Arista didn\u2019t take long. \u201cThe features, simplified licensing, and lower cost made it an easy decision. All switches operate on the same firmware, which makes updates and programming much easier.\u201d Results came quickly. Security posture improved with modern hardware. CloudVision provided end-to-end visibility and control across every location. Configuration changes and software updates now roll out with speed and minimal disruption. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very pleased with the devices and products installed so far,\u201d Peace said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see the improvements once all our facilities are migrated to Arista.\u201d</p> <p>The Town of Webster\u2019s journey reflects a growing trend across Upstate New York. Towns, counties, and public agencies are choosing Arista to simplify their networks, bolster security, and gain the agility to support evolving community needs. Whether managing large-scale cloud infrastructure or securing essential services for a local government, Arista delivers the same standard of reliability, visibility, and innovation.</p> <p>What sets Arista apart?</p> <ul> <li>A single operating system across campus, data center, WAN, and branch</li> <li>Real-time streaming telemetry with AI-driven insights from CloudVision</li> <li>Orders of magnitude fewer bugs and security vulnerabilities than any competitor</li> <li>Industry-leading customer satisfaction and a Net Promoter Score of +87</li> </ul> <p>For more information on how Arista can help modernize your network, contact Jeramiah Pauly at jpauly@arista.com</p>"},{"location":"August2025/#feel-free-to-reach-out-to-us-for-your-network-needs","title":"Feel Free to Reach Out To Us For Your Network Needs","text":"<p>We thank you for taking the time to read our newsletter today.

A welcome reprieve after the region's long precipitation season.  The phrase itself conjures recollection of the sun reflecting off lakes, lush mountains, long sun-drenched days and the aromatic flora surrounding us.  It's a time when nature bursts forth in growth and calls us to act on ambitious outdoor projects.  We are called to begin the constant effort of tending to our outdoor spaces.  Just like a flourishing garden, an enterprise network requires constant attention.</p> <p>Imagine your garden. A persistent patch of dandelions has taken root, their bright yellow heads a cheerful but ultimately detrimental sight. You could, of course, easily snip off the heads.  For a brief time, the problem appears to be gone.  The garden looks tidier. This is the equivalent of fixing a problem on your network.  A switch port goes down; you reboot the switch.  A user complains of slow access; you restart their machine. These are quick, reactive measures that address the immediate symptoms. They offer a temporary reprieve, a superficial act masking a deeper issue.  The dandelions, you see, still have their roots firmly embedded, ready to sprout anew with the next rainfall.  What's worse, we frequently water our gardens in between rainfall encouraging weed growth at that same pace as our desirable growth.</p> <p>Weeding, on the other hand, is a more deliberate and far more effective process.  It involves getting down on your hands and knees, understanding the plant's growth pattern, and carefully extracting the entire root system.  It's often messier, much more time-consuming, and requires a deeper understanding of the underlying biology.  Much like solving that persistent fundamental problem with your network.</p> <p>Consider that slow application complaint, this time it\u2019s from a corporate VIP.  Instead of a quick reboot, a \"weeding\" approach would involve delving into the network.  Is it a bandwidth issue?  A misconfigured QoS setting?  A rogue application monopolizing resources?  Are there aging, non-standard cables or faulty network cards that are consistently degrading performance?  Perhaps the network architecture itself, once perfectly adequate, is no longer scaling to meet the modern demands of today\u2019s workforce or new cloud-based applications.   </p> <p>Identifying the root cause requires a comprehensive view of the network path and its performance \u2013  whether it's an inefficient proprietary feature / protocol, a tangle of software versions laced with their unique bugs, or a lack of proper network segmentation; you wouldn't know which root to pull without visibility across the entire packet path.  Demand for immediate relief may not afford you the time for systematically addressing it hence the giving in to clipping the weed.</p> <p>Maintaining an enterprise network is not merely about reacting to outages or defending against the criticism.  It's about proactive care and willingness to acknowledge \u201cproblems that can be solved\u201d.  Just as a gardener doesn't wait for their blooms to be overtaken by non-native plants before tending to them.  This involves continuous monitoring, performance baseline, regular security audits, and a commitment to understanding the evolving needs of the business.</p> <p>Arista Networks' CloudVision Universal Network Observability (CV UNO) is a network observability solution that leverages DANZ Monitoring Fabric (DMF) for deeper insights into network and application performance. CV UNO uses machine learning and data analytics to provide proactive risk analysis, real-time impact analysis, and accelerated issue resolution. The DMF acts as a foundation for CV UNO, providing the infrastructure for capturing and filtering network traffic, while CV UNO analyzes this data to identify anomalies and performance issues.</p> <p>In the warmth of an Upstate New York summer, as the garden thrives under thoughtful cultivation, so too can your network flourish when its stewards adopt a \"weeding\" mindset. By consistently seeking out and eradicating the root causes of network vulnerabilities, rather than just snipping at the symptoms, organizations can cultivate a culture of analysis and continuous improvement, where every \"fix\" is viewed as an opportunity to understand the underlying \"weed\" and actively prevent its recurrence.  CV UNO is that perfect tool for the job.  The reward may well include network engineers who will enjoy more of the revitalizing seasonal activities this short season has to offer, and a business that delivers to its clients.</p>"},{"location":"July2025/#feel-free-to-reach-out-to-us-for-your-network-needs","title":"Feel Free to Reach Out To Us For Your Network Needs","text":"<p>We thank you for taking the time to read our newsletter today.

Maybe your inbox is quiet. The helpdesk isn\u2019t chasing you down. Syslog looks clean. Nobody's asking for a maintenance window. Devices have been up for months\u2014maybe even years. All signs point to a stable, well-behaved network. However, stability alone doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.</p> <p>What about security? Can that be used as a metric for good network health? I\u2019d argue yes, absolutely. Just because nothing appears broken doesn\u2019t mean your network isn\u2019t vulnerable to being exposed. A \u201chealthy\u201d network on the surface could still be running outdated software and missing critical patches.  In today\u2019s environment, a strong security posture has to be part of how we define operational health.</p> <p>So why don\u2019t we all keep our devices as current as possible? In many cases, it\u2019s not because we don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s because upgrades have historically been painful. With legacy network OS\u2019s, a software upgrade often means disruption. Even when everything goes as planned, you could still see an impact. Sometimes just 30 seconds, but even that can be too long in environments that require 24/7 availability.</p> <p>The good news is that this doesn\u2019t have to be the tradeoff anymore. If you're running a modern network OS, like Arista EOS, upgrades don\u2019t have to be a compromise. Arista Smart System Upgrade (SSU) gives you a way to upgrade software with no impact to connected hosts, even if they only have a single link. SSU keeps forwarding data during the upgrade, so users don\u2019t notice a thing (&lt; 100 ms). You can now treat software upgrades as a normal part of healthy operations without fear of outages. </p> <p>As you evaluate your network\u2019s health, make sure you\u2019re not just measuring silence. Include upgradability in your assessment. Because a healthy network isn\u2019t just quiet. It's secure.</p> <p>Want to learn more about Smart System Upgrade (SSU)?

But what if I told you that a switch can be much more than a simple piece of hardware? In fact, the right switch can be the difference between a network that\u2019s stuck in the past and one that\u2019s ready for the future. The truth is, not all switches are created equal.

However, as the traditional network perimeter disappears\u2014driven by the dynamic placement of applications in the cloud and the adoption of SaaS solutions\u2014organizations now face greater vulnerabilities. The push to offer seamless access to key resources for employees and contractors, often through BYOD policies, further increases this risk. Additionally, many threat actors now employ sophisticated, malware-free techniques that can cause significant damage, even when data is fully encrypted.  </p> <p>Driven by evolving security challenges, Zero Trust has emerged as a top priority for enterprises. As a leading provider of networking solutions to enterprise customers, Arista recognizes that the network itself can be leveraged to enhance enterprise security in innovative and efficient ways\u2014delivering robust protection without adding unnecessary complexity while maintaining a seamless experience for all users and stakeholders. While Zero Trust encompasses a broad range of security domains and requires contributions from various technologies\u2014including firewalls, endpoint detection and response (EDR), and other security services\u2014the network remains foundational. Every user, device, and application relies on the network to communicate, positioning it as a critical control point for enforcing security policies and enabling real-time visibility and threat response across the enterprise.  </p> <p>  Arista Zero Trust Networking </p> <p>Arista\u2019s Zero Trust architecture is a combination of various functions starting from  </p> <ol> <li> <p>Identity-based adaptive access control: Arista\u2019s AGNI (Arista Guardian Network Identity) system serves as a network access control policy engine that provides access to users and devices no matter where they connect over wired or wireless networks. It can be a policy engine for corporate users, devices, guest users, BYOD, and IoT. It meets the zero-trust requirement of trusting nothing and always knowing the identity of every endpoint. AGNI also helps operators restrict what users or devices can access once they are on the network.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Based on the user\u2019s identity, we can create identity-aware microperimeters that are completely decoupled from the underlying network topology. Arista\u2019s ZTX traffic mapper appliance (physical or virtual) can then monitor all session-level activity in the network and provide the operator a clear view of the communication activity. The operator can create policies based on that identity-aware view.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Multi Domain Microsegmentation Services (Arista MSS) can then enforce the identity-aware segmentation at the network's edge and greatly simplify or limit the need for the firewall to just inter-zone traffic\u2014this kind of identity-aware enforcement further limits lateral movement within the network. Even if someone were to infiltrate the network, Arista MSS would greatly reduce the attacker's ability by restricting movement beyond what is allowed for that group, which is explicitly governed through the policy.

Unlike traditional network operating systems, EOS is built on a database-driven model, enabling real-time state streaming and management.    </p> <p>This article explores the evolution of EOS, focusing on its core databases\u2014SysDB, NetDB, and NetDL.  </p> <p>SysDB is the core of a switch that holds the state information of a switch. SysDB, or System Database,  exists in every Arista switch. It stores the state of all 100+ agents, or processes, running on the switch. The agents communicate through a publish and subscribe model to SysDB, therefore agents do not communicate with each other directly but only with SysDB. This prevents agent interdependency and cascading failures within the operating system. Also, by separating agent state from processing, we have created a more resilient and fault tolerant switching architecture. An agent that goes offline simply needs to pull its last known state from SysDB upon re-initilization to begin processing as if no failure occurred. To summarize, SysDB serves as a centralized database within each EOS switch, however, the next evolution of EOS goes beyond a single device.   </p> <p> </p> <p>NetDB is the next evolution of EOS, and it operates by collecting data from all of our Arista EOS switches. NetDB allows us to aggregate all the switches' state information in one location. The evolution from SysDB to NetDB led to the creation of our Network management and orchestration platform CloudVision. While this was a big step forward, we wanted to expand our visibility from EOS devices to now include information from all aspects of our network.   </p> <p>NetDL is the latest evolution of EOS. NetDL is a series of databases that aggregates information from all aspects of our network, not just the switching infrastructure. This can include data from our EOS devices, wireless, security, IoT, Virtualized, and 3rd party infrastructure. This led to the creation of CV-UNO (Universal Network Observability), which ingests all of the additional data into CloudVision, giving the network operator much wider visibility into their entire network. Also, since NetDL provides us with an expansive collection of network data in one location, Arista's AI/ML solution AVA (Autonomous Virtual Assist) can leverage the data to provide customers with real time remediation recommendations, reducing MTTR.   </p> <p> </p> <p>In conclusion, EOS evolved from a single database located on a single switch, to a network wide database aggregating every switch's state information, to an encompassing series of databases aggregating data from every aspect and interaction within our network.  </p> <p>To learn more, click on the links below: Ken Duda \"EOS: A Tale of Opposite Architectures\" Ken Duda \"Arista NetDL Evolution\" Arista AVA (Autonomous Virtual Assist) </p>"},{"location":"May2025/#upcoming-events","title":"Upcoming Events","text":"<p>Arista hosts various events throughout the year for you!

Protecting against increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks and data breaches is not likely to be a reality that retired IT executives will sit around and reminisce over.</p> <p>The threat landscape is always changing, and traditional perimeter defenses simply aren't enough. Attackers are inside, moving laterally, and blending in with normal business traffic across your LAN.  So why not employ your network (regardless of network vendor; i.e., Ci$%*, Ju^#$%, Fo<sup>%$#@</sup>) as part of your security solution?</p> <p>Traditional security solutions struggle with a landscape where attacks continue to evolve beyond malware: supply chain threats, insider attacks, and living off the land tactics, among others. At the same time, a new network has emerged with unmanaged Internet of Things, cloud infrastructure, contractor and third-party devices, and shadow IT. While the new network continues to gain prominence and transcend enterprise perimeters, it has become vital for organizations to address the cascading attack surface and to build an integrated cybersecurity strategy that delivers holistic visibility and control.</p> <p>The Arista Network Detection and Response (NDR) platform is completely vendor agnostic. It will work with anyone's network. Arista's NDR is built on a foundation of deep network analysis from AVA Sensors that span the \u201dnew network\u201d\u2014including the data center, campus, IoT, as well as cloud workload networks, and SaaS applications. These sensors can be appliance-based, hypervisor-based, or exist in the Cloud. And if you have Arista switches in your closets, you may already have the NDR sensors built in.</p> <p>Unlike other network detection and response solutions, Arista NDR parses over three thousand protocols and processes layer 2 through layer 7 data. The platform also analyzes encrypted protocols to identify important context such as the nature of traffic (file transfer, interactive shell, etc.), the applications communicating, and the presence of remote access, all without forcing data decryption. Arista\u2019s EntityIQ\u2122 technology uses this information to autonomously profile entities such as devices, users, and applications while preserving these communications for future forensic analysis.</p> <p>Extracted activity data feeds into the AVA Nucleus which uses a combination of detection models to uncover malicious intent. An ensemble of machine learning approaches avoids reliance on simplistic and noisy anomaly detection or unsupervised learning. The AVA Nucleus can run entirely on-premises or in customer cloud environments as well as delivered as a SaaS offering hosted in Arista cloud infrastructure.</p> <p> </p> <p>Arista\u2019s Adversarial Modeling\u2122 language enables the uncovering of even the most complex attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) with extensible AI-driven models that first zero in on the suspicious activity and then gather corroborating evidence to support conviction. The modeling language delivers rich data analysis capabilities and a vocabulary to express attacker TTPs so that even a relatively junior analyst can now hunt for sophisticated threats. The AVA Nucleus provides a single sign-on and role-based user experience, and a full API for extensibility, notifications, and integrations with other IT and security solutions for automated response and remediation.</p> <p>Superior to other NDR vendors when it comes to:</p> <ul> <li>Accuracy - we have the highest Signal-to-Noise Ratio by far (fewest false positives and fewest false negatives), which means we won't miss real attacks. Anecdotally, our 24x7 Managed NDR service hasn't missed a red team test in any of our customers' environments in years!</li> <li>Automated Device Identification and Risk Profiling - we analyze your traffic using AI to figure out who's on your network and what they're doing, independent of any CMDB or asset management system (or even LDAP or AD, for that matter). We then profile each device to reveal the context analysts need to take action against compromised devices.</li> <li>Openness and Extensibility - all of our Adversarial Models (detections) are fully exposed and well documented, enabling your security team to see exactly why behaviors triggered an alert, which no other vendor does at all well. Furthermore, we have an unparalleled query language that allows security analysts to easily customize our models or build their own detections.</li> </ul> <p>Ready to learn how Arista NDR can eliminate blind spots and empower your security team? </p>"},{"location":"October2025/#feel-free-to-reach-out-to-us-for-your-network-needs","title":"Feel Free to Reach Out To Us For Your Network Needs","text":"<p>We thank you for taking the time to read our newsletter today.

The airwaves are continuously saturated with everything from neighboring rogue Wi-Fi networks to microwaves in the break room heating your co-workers' lunch. The last thing we want to interrupt are the valuable radio cycles dedicated to any given user device. In order to adapt to a real time RF environment, access points have historically consumed bits of those client cycles to successfully channel plan, power plan, and avoid inevitable interference. </p> <p>But what if we didn\u2019t have to live in that world any longer?</p> <p>I\u2019d like to take a moment to highlight the Multifunction Radio present in many of Arista Networks access points. A dedicated Tri-Band radio that is capable of giving those client radio cycles back to the clients! A true swiss army knife of the wireless world. Not only does this radio take over the burden of traditional client radio background scanning, it offers a breadth of tools to add to your engineers toolbelt. A few of my favorites include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The ability to turn this radio into a client! Gain real time network insights for a specific location and simulate day-to-day traffic activities. These include simple throughput testing, VoIP calling tests, or even simulating reachability to your custom applications. Run these tests against neighboring APs before ever stepping foot onsite.</p> </li> <li> <p>Always available Spectrum Analysis - Stop spending your wi-fi budget on additional standalone spectrum sensors!</p> </li> <li> <p>Over-The-Air Packet Captures - Get a deeper analysis of your environment by capturing Management, Data and Control Frames from an AP and surrounding APs.</p> </li> </ul> <p>These are all very useful tools to support an ever-changing wireless environment.</p> <p>  Arista Multifunction Radio Uses </p> <p>Give your Wi-Fi a break and consider adding the Arista Multifunction Radio to your fleet.

That has held true for my 9 year tenure. </p> <p>When people are exposed to Arista, light bulbs go off, they evaluate our technology, then they purchase it - every time.  And they never stop thanking us for helping to make their lives easier. They don\u2019t have to chase as many outages from bugs. They don\u2019t have to create downtime to fix security vulnerabilities. They have their nights, weekends and holidays back and can spend more time doing the things they love.</p> <p>I cannot think of a single reason to work with legacy network providers.  Arista already has everything that everyone is searching for in a modern network infrastructure.</p> <ul> <li>Five nines reliability (99.999% uptime) </li> <li>Hitless upgrades</li> <li>Network-wide automation</li> <li>Real-time streaming telemetry</li> <li>Seamless and massive scalability</li> <li>Holistic security</li> <li>Simplicity</li> <li>etc. </li> </ul> <p>all built on open-standards protocols. </p> <p>No proprietary lock-in.</p> <p>And the best thing - the thing that application developers, operations managers and network engineers alike LOVE THE MOST - is a completely UNIFIED OPERATING ENVIRONMENT.  </p> <p>Yes - ONE operating system and ONE management platform across all previous network \u201csilos\u201d: LAN, WAN, MAN, DC, Campus, Switching, Routing, Cloud, etc.  </p> <p>We can\u2019t imagine how organizations have been running on such fragmented silos - each with their own OS; each with their own management tools; each with their own unique set of bugs and security holes. How can your business nimbly capture new markets - with first mover advantage - when you\u2019re constantly engaged in fixing the plethora of disparate systems you already have?</p> <p>With varying, fragmented silos, how can you have a unified automation strategy?  How can you uniformly apply Zero Trust Policies? How long does it take to certify new applications or app changes across an abundance of operating systems? Think of how long it takes to patch security holes in every binary of your infrastructure. And then all the licensing - don\u2019t get me started\u2026</p> <p>Those that have joined the Arista family tell us how much less grunt-work they do. The #1 compliment we receive is \u201cYour systems just work\u201d.  How nice. </p> <p>The network SHOULD just work so that YOU can do REAL work for the company. </p> <p>Again, I say that Arista already has everything everyone is looking for - without the headaches. It was built from the ground up to unify all the traditional silos with a stunning history of quality, reliability and stability.</p> <p>Now, Arista is not perfect. This is software, after all. Software is a human endeavor and humans are not yet perfect. And even now, with the advent of AI-generated software, one cannot test EVERY possible situation. YOUR network is unique - it\u2019s going to present anomalies to every new technology. </p> <p>And here\u2019s Arista\u2019s critical advantage: it has a Technical Assistance Center (TAC) staffed only by Level 3 engineers. No escalations, no complex VRUs to get through before you speak to a Level 1 engineer who asks questions that insult your intelligence, then a Level 2 engineer who doesn\u2019t understand your problem; then a \u201cduty manager\u201d (always makes me laugh - thank you Chandler Bing), THEN finally (maybe) a smarty.  </p> <p>Arista TAC: 30 seconds to get to an Arista-badged, Level 3 engineer.  No entitlement questions asked.  Problem solved.</p> <p>Our clients LOVE THIS.  We know because they tell us.</p> <p>When I joined Arista our revenue was just shy of $1B. I wondered to myself \u201cA Level 3-only TAC is well and good for a small &lt;$1B company, but how will that scale?\u201d  But here we are now - 8 times the size of when I started, and we still have a +87 NPS Score TAC that answers your call in under 30 seconds with A LEVEL-3 ENGINEER WHO WILL SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM.</p> <p>The reason we\u2019ve been able to hold on to that model is because of the quality of our code. </p> <p>When you get quality right, you get everything right.</p> <p>This cannot be understated. </p> <p>As a result, Arista has orders of magnitude fewer regression bugs and security vulnerabilities than the competition.</p> <p>Fewer bugs &amp; CVEs means fewer critical support calls.</p> <p>Fewer TAC calls means you can staff it with the best smarties - without bankrupting the company.</p> <p>In Upstate NY, we\u2019ve installed over 5,000 switches and routers across a 12-13 year period. Not one serious network outage. I\u2019ve not been on a single P1 (network down) crisis call; not one P2 (network severely degraded) call. I\u2019ve not had to work nights, weekends or holidays because OUR CLIENTS have not had to work nights, weekends or holidays.</p> <p>No other network vendor has all of these qualities. This is how and why we\u2019ve grown to a nearly $10B company - not by slick marketing and deceptive advertising, but BY WORD OF MOUTH. </p> <p>And that word of mouth is: \u201cArista just works\u201d.</p> <p>So again I say: our greatest competition is people not knowing about us. </p> <p>Help us spread the word. </p>"},{"location":"September2025/#feel-free-to-reach-out-to-us-for-your-network-needs","title":"Feel Free to Reach Out To Us For Your Network Needs","text":"<p>We thank you for taking the time to read our newsletter today.
