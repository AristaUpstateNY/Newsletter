## **Article #1 - Is Your Wi-Fi Working Overtime?**
By: Jacob Darling,  Systems Engineer, Upstate NY Region

<div class="article-section" markdown>

As engineers, we strive to give our wireless clients the best signal, the best throughput, and the most reliable airtime. The airwaves are continuously saturated with everything from neighboring rogue Wi-Fi networks to microwaves in the break room heating your co-workers' lunch. The last thing we want to interrupt are the valuable radio cycles dedicated to any given user device. In order to adapt to a real time RF environment, access points have historically consumed bits of those client cycles to successfully channel plan, power plan, and avoid inevitable interference. 

**But what if we didn’t have to live in that world any longer?**

I’d like to take a moment to highlight the Multifunction Radio present in many of Arista Networks access points. A dedicated Tri-Band radio that is capable of giving those client radio cycles back to the clients! A true swiss army knife of the wireless world. Not only does this radio take over the burden of traditional client radio background scanning, it offers a breadth of tools to add to your engineers toolbelt. A few of my favorites include:

- The ability to turn this radio **into a client!** Gain real time network insights for a specific location and simulate day-to-day traffic activities. These include simple throughput testing, VoIP calling tests, or even simulating reachability to your custom applications. Run these tests against neighboring APs before ever stepping foot onsite.

- Always available **Spectrum Analysis** - Stop spending your wi-fi budget on additional standalone spectrum sensors!

- Over-The-Air **Packet Captures** - Get a deeper analysis of your environment by capturing Management, Data and Control Frames from an AP and surrounding APs.

These are all very useful tools to support an ever-changing wireless environment.

## **Article #2 - The Biggest Threat to Arista Networks** 
By: Rob Montone, Region Manager, Upstate NY Region

<div class="article-section" markdown>

Folks, after nearly a decade of being with Arista, many of you have heard me say that our greatest competition - the biggest threat to Arista - is people not knowing about us. That has held true for my 9 year tenure. 

When people are exposed to Arista, light bulbs go off, they evaluate our technology, then they purchase it - every time.  And they never stop thanking us for helping to make their lives easier. They don’t have to chase as many outages from bugs. They don’t have to create downtime to fix security vulnerabilities. They have their nights, weekends and holidays back and can spend more time doing the things they love.

I cannot think of a single reason to work with legacy network providers. 
Arista already has everything that everyone is searching for in a modern network infrastructure.

- Five nines reliability (99.999% uptime) 
- Hitless upgrades
- Network-wide automation
- Real-time streaming telemetry
- Seamless and massive scalability
- Holistic security
- Simplicity
- etc. 
  
all built on **open-standards protocols.** 

No proprietary lock-in.

And the best thing - the thing that application developers, operations managers and network engineers alike LOVE THE MOST - is a completely UNIFIED OPERATING ENVIRONMENT.  

Yes - ONE operating system and ONE management platform across all previous network “silos”:  
LAN, WAN, MAN, DC, Campus, Switching, Routing, Cloud, etc.  

We can’t imagine how organizations have been running on such fragmented silos - each with their own OS; each with their own management tools; each with their own unique set of bugs and security holes. How can your business nimbly capture new markets - with first mover advantage - when you’re constantly engaged in fixing the plethora of disparate systems you already have?

With varying, fragmented silos, how can you have a unified automation strategy?  How can you uniformly apply Zero Trust Policies? How long does it take to certify new applications or app changes across an abundance of operating systems? Think of how long it takes to patch security holes in every binary of your infrastructure. And then all the licensing - don’t get me started…

Those that have joined the Arista family tell us how much less grunt-work they do.  
The #1 compliment we receive is “Your systems just work”. 
How nice. 

The network SHOULD just work so that YOU can do REAL work for the company. 

Again, I say that Arista already has everything everyone is looking for - without the headaches. It was built from the ground up to unify all the traditional silos with a stunning history of quality, reliability and stability.

Now, Arista is not perfect. This is software, after all. Software is a human endeavor and humans are not yet perfect. And even now, with the advent of AI-generated software, one cannot test EVERY possible situation. YOUR network is unique - it’s going to present anomalies to every new technology. 

And here’s Arista’s critical advantage: it has a Technical Assistance Center (TAC) staffed only by Level 3 engineers. No escalations, no complex VRUs to get through before you speak to a Level 1 engineer who asks questions that insult your intelligence, then a Level 2 engineer who doesn’t understand your problem; then a “duty manager” (always makes me laugh - thank you Chandler Bing), THEN finally (maybe) a smarty.  

**Arista TAC:** 30 seconds to get to an Arista-badged, Level 3 engineer. 
No entitlement questions asked. 
Problem solved.

Our clients LOVE THIS. 
We know because they tell us.

When I joined Arista our revenue was just shy of $1B. I wondered to myself “A Level 3-only TAC is well and good for a small <$1B company, but how will that scale?”  But here we are now - 8 times the size of when I started, and we still have a +87 NPS Score TAC that answers your call in under 30 seconds with A LEVEL-3 ENGINEER WHO WILL SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM.

The reason we’ve been able to hold on to that model is because of the quality of our code. 

When you get quality right, you get everything right.

This cannot be understated. 

As a result, Arista has orders of magnitude fewer regression bugs and security vulnerabilities than the competition.

Fewer bugs & CVEs means fewer critical support calls.

Fewer TAC calls means you can staff it with the best smarties - without bankrupting the company.

In Upstate NY, we’ve installed over 5,000 switches and routers across a 12-13 year period. Not one serious network outage. I’ve not been on a single P1 (network down) crisis call; not one P2 (network severely degraded) call. I’ve not had to work nights, weekends or holidays because OUR CLIENTS have not had to work nights, weekends or holidays.

No other network vendor has all of these qualities. This is how and why we’ve grown to a nearly $10B company - not by slick marketing and deceptive advertising, but BY WORD OF MOUTH. 

And that word of mouth is: “Arista just works”.

So again I say: our greatest competition is people not knowing about us. 

Help us spread the word.
