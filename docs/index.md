## **Article #1 - How Do You Judge the Health of Your Network?**
By: Joe Mitri,  Senior Systems Engineer, Upstate NY Region

As engineers, we have no shortage of metrics to measure the health of our networks. Maybe your inbox is quiet. The helpdesk isn’t chasing you down. Syslog looks clean. Nobody's asking for a maintenance window. Devices have been up for months—maybe even years. All signs point to a stable, well-behaved network. However, stability alone doesn’t tell the whole story.

What about security? Can that be used as a metric for good network health? I’d argue yes, absolutely. Just because nothing appears broken doesn’t mean your network isn’t vulnerable to being exposed. A “healthy” network on the surface could still be running outdated software and missing critical patches.  In today’s environment, a strong security posture has to be part of how we define operational health.

So why don’t we all keep our devices as current as possible? In many cases, it’s not because we don’t want to. It’s because upgrades have historically been painful. With legacy network OS’s, a software upgrade often means disruption. Even when everything goes as planned, you could still see an impact. Sometimes just 30 seconds, but even that can be too long in environments that require 24/7 availability.

The good news is that this doesn’t have to be the tradeoff anymore. If you're running a modern network OS, like Arista EOS, upgrades don’t have to be a compromise. [Arista Smart System Upgrade (SSU)](https://www.arista.com/en/um-eos/eos-smart-system-upgrade ) gives you a way to upgrade software with no impact to connected hosts, even if they only have a single link. SSU keeps forwarding data during the upgrade, so users don’t notice a thing (< 100 ms). You can now treat software upgrades as a normal part of healthy operations without fear of outages. 

As you evaluate your network’s health, make sure you’re not just measuring silence. Include upgradability in your assessment. Because a healthy network isn’t just quiet. It's secure.

## **Article #2 - A switch is a switch is a switch … or is it?** 
By: Jeramiah Pauly,  Associate Account Manager, Upstate NY Region

Let’s face it, when it comes to networking, we all know the drill. The term “switch” is tossed around like it’s just one box to plug in and call it a day. After all, isn’t a switch just a switch? But what if I told you that a switch can be much more than a simple piece of hardware? In fact, the right switch can be the difference between a network that’s stuck in the past and one that’s ready for the future. The truth is, not all switches are created equal. Arista Networks provides the critical infrastructure for your network so that it doesn’t just survive—it thrives.

For years, network managers in Upstate New York have been trapped with legacy networking equipment that’s as complicated as it is expensive. The "one-size-fits-all" approach has led to endless subscription fees, complex configurations, and network downtime that simply shouldn’t exist in 2025. What Arista offers is not just another switch. For over 20 years, Arista has pioneered a new way of thinking about networking. Think to yourself, “Have I seen a movie on Netflix lately, posted a picture on Facebook or listened to a song on Spotify?” If so, you’ve already experienced the power of Arista Networks!

With Arista’s Extensible Operating System (EOS), switches are no longer just about connecting devices. They’re about automating network operations with CloudVision, optimizing performance, and simplifying management. In other words, Arista turned the humble switch into a tool that adapts and scales with your needs, not the other way around.

**Why Arista?**  
**Simplification**: Intuitive, automated solutions that reduce network complexity<br>
**Flexibility**: Open, scalable solutions that adapt to evolving business needs<br>
**Security**: Consistently orders of magnitude fewer regression bugs than any other network OS

Arista’s commitment to open standards and flexible, high-performance solutions means your network isn’t just built for today, it’s prepared for tomorrow. From zero-touch provisioning to seamless scalability, Arista’s portfolio is designed to reduce complexity while increasing reliability. So, next time you hear someone say “a switch is just a switch,” you’ll know. Arista is the world’s most advanced networking company. Period.
