## **Article #1 - A Commitment to Self-Improving Innovation**
By: Joe Mitri,  Senior Systems Engineer, Upstate NY Region

<div class="article-section" markdown>


The other night I was walking through the grocery store. One of those late-night runs when the crowds are gone and the shelves are half empty. Passing the bakery, I saw it: one lonely, forgotten cupcake sitting on a tray like it had missed the party.

Then I noticed a rainbow of balloons swaying under the AC vents and had a sudden sinking feeling. Did I forget a birthday?

I pulled out my phone to check. Sure enough, I had. But in my defense, it never said a word. Not even a hint.

Somewhere between monitoring compliance and pushing configs, CloudVision quietly turned ten. And true to form, there was no drama, no fanfare, just a decade of being one of the most capable, feature-rich, and underrated platforms in networking.

So yes, this article is a belated birthday card. No balloons. But I did buy the cupcake 🧁.

In an industry where platforms are often discarded and reinvented every few years, CloudVision stands out as a rare example of evolution. A decade long commitment to self-improving innovation. More than just a management interface, it has become the foundation of operational simplicity and visibility across Arista deployments.

When CloudVision launched in 2015, it offered a single point of visibility for the entire network fabric. It was built on open standards and designed to scale. What is more impressive is how it has grown. Over the past decade, CloudVision has added live streaming telemetry, workflow automation, network auditability and compliance, campus-focused features, multi-domain security, AI-driven analytics, and much more. Not as bolt-ons or afterthoughts, but as integrated capabilities with a clear and consistent design vision that spans your entire Arista network.

For ten years, CloudVision has helped customers move from their legacy architectures to a modern operating model. It has reduced operational costs, increased uptime, and improved security. From healthcare to education to finance, and everything in between, every enterprise can benefit from doing more with less.

I, for one, cannot wait to see what CloudVision does next.

## **Article #2 - From Hyperscale to Hometown – Why the Town of Webster Trusts Arista** 
By: Jeramiah Pauly,  Associate Account Manager, Upstate NY Region

<div class="article-section" markdown>

Arista, recently named one of Forbes’ Top 15 Best Companies in America for 2025, powers the backbone of global cloud giants like Microsoft and Meta. But some of our most meaningful success stories are unfolding much closer to home. One such example is in the Town of Webster, New York, where local government leaders turned to Arista to modernize their critical network infrastructure.

This month, we spoke with Steve Peace, Director of Information Technology, and John Camille, Network Administrator for the Town of Webster, to learn how Arista is reshaping their operations from the ground up. “Eye-opening. That’s the short version,” said Camille. “The longer version? Arista has completely changed how we think about and manage our network.”

Like many municipalities, Webster’s network had developed organically over time, with a patchwork of vendors and gear. That led to complexity, inconsistent configurations, and a reliance on workarounds instead of streamlined solutions. According to Camille, the change since deploying Arista has been dramatic. “Now, we can rack and configure a switch on-site and push configurations through CloudVision. What used to take days now takes hours.”

CloudVision, Arista’s management and analytics platform, has also revolutionized how Webster troubleshoots and plans their network. “The level of visibility and insight into client experience and network health is unmatched. We can show exactly where things are working and where they’re not. No guesswork, just facts.”

Camille highlighted the daily tools that have become essential to his team’s operations: dashboards, topology mapping, CVE and bug visibility, MAC address history, health monitoring, and configlet management—all within CloudVision. “Change management used to mean reading twenty pages of documentation, digging through forum threads, and deciphering handwritten notes,” he said. “Now, it’s one platform, one book, one design. It just works. Working with Arista makes everything easier—management, planning, implementation, and yes, even budgeting.”

From a leadership standpoint, the Town of Webster had clear goals: simplify network management, improve performance, and strengthen security. For Steve Peace, cost savings and long-term sustainability were critical factors in evaluating a new vendor. “We wanted to improve manageability, increase performance, eliminate vendor creep, and enhance our security posture by being able to easily install updates and fixes,” Peace explained. “We also needed a solution with the fewest CVEs in the market and at a lower cost. Arista checked every box.”

According to Peace, the decision to go with Arista didn’t take long. “The features, simplified licensing, and lower cost made it an easy decision. All switches operate on the same firmware, which makes updates and programming much easier.” Results came quickly. Security posture improved with modern hardware. CloudVision provided end-to-end visibility and control across every location. Configuration changes and software updates now roll out with speed and minimal disruption. “We’ve been very pleased with the devices and products installed so far,” Peace said. “I can’t wait to see the improvements once all our facilities are migrated to Arista.”

The Town of Webster’s journey reflects a growing trend across Upstate New York. Towns, counties, and public agencies are choosing Arista to simplify their networks, bolster security, and gain the agility to support evolving community needs. Whether managing large-scale cloud infrastructure or securing essential services for a local government, Arista delivers the same standard of reliability, visibility, and innovation.

What sets Arista apart?

- A single operating system across campus, data center, WAN, and branch
- Real-time streaming telemetry with AI-driven insights from CloudVision
- Orders of magnitude fewer bugs and security vulnerabilities than any competitor
- Industry-leading customer satisfaction and a Net Promoter Score of +87
